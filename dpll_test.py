# (sets, lists, or iterables) of literals, with at least `MIN_CLAUSE_SIZE`
# literals and at most `MAX_CLAUSE_SIZE` literals.
# 
# Use the `unique_by` parameter to create sequences of literals that do not
# contain multiple literals with the same variable number. We don't want clauses
# like `-1 OR 1`. See documentation here:
# https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.lists
